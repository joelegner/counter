# counter

This program is pretty simple. It gives you some instructions and displays the number 0 (zero). That's the counter.

The arrow keys increase or decrease the counter. Escape resets the counter. The letter `q` or CTRL+C exits the program. 

Here is how you build it:

```bash
$ go install .
```

Here is how you run it without installing it:

```bash
$ go run .
```

This is what it does:

```
$ counter

Escape: reset to 0
Spacebar or Right Arrow: +1
Backspace or Left Arrow: -1
q or CTRL+C: Quit
Counter: 0
```

# Background

I am not much of a programmer, know little about Go, yet I wrote this program in 1 hour -- using ChatGPT. It was pretty amazing. It has opened doors to my imagination by reducing the friction to write another program. When it's easy to do something like this, I bet I will think of other applications!

Right out of the gate it wrote a working program. The most time-consuming parts were the tweaks and then getting it put up on Github. I'm just not very skilled at using git. 

The "programming" -- if you call it that -- was easy. I just kept prompting ChatGPT to add more code, different options, different keystrokes. Once I saw how it was done, I added some more manually. That's all it took to write this program. I now share it with the world and hope somebody finds it fun. I am using it to count repetitions while practicing music.
