# counter

This program is pretty simple. It gives you some instructions and displays the number 0 (zero). That's the counter.

The arrow keys increase or decrease the counter. Escape resets the counter. The letter `q` or CTRL+C exits the program. 

Here is how you build it:

```bash
$ go install .
```

Here is how you run it without installing it:

```bash
$ go run .
```

This is what it does:

```
